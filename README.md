# Drinking_Game
A mobile game that involves challenges you have to do.<br><br>
Programmed in Java, the game has an online mode as well as an offline mode, so you can play anywhere. The online mode is made by connecting all players to an entry in a Firebase realtime database, all players listening to changes made.<br>
<br> The only change a player can make is click the screen, which then changes the question for all players connected to the lobby. In order to invite players to a lobby a dynamic link is created when a player creates a lobby. This dynamic link can be shared with other people, so when they click it it launches the app and you are prompted to insert a name for this specific lobby.
